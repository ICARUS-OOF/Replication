They're desperate and losing it, I know they are. They just lost all the territory they had gained early in the war, and are just throwing money at whatever they think is going to be their saving grace. They're sending one of their best to be our lab rat, some guy named Pedro.

To be perfectly honest, I'm done with this company. It was only a couple days ago that they sent me the letter that my love was killed in an enemy assault. "She died for our country", they said. Screw that!

They started this war, and they're the ones who are gonna pay for the cost. They just accepted me into the project earlier, and it's going to be their last mistake.

They're unusually coordinated and frenzied, they took out nearly half of the riot control units in less than 15 minutes!

I've locked myself in the armory with some of the others. The higher-ups keep yelling at us to get out and deal with the riots, but like hell I'm going out there ever again! I saw a whole crowd beat a single guard to a pulp!

I don't know how long it will be until they reach us. If I make it out of here alive I'm finding the lead scientist and putting a bullet in his cranium.

Those Frankensteins caused this. I'm sure of it.

Since our oh-so-beloved government decided that it's best to channel everything - and I mean literally everything - into the war effort, they've sacked the economy and forced thousands into the uniform. Inflation and unemployment is at an all time high, families are starving on the streets, and it's all for the "greater good".

Cant say I enjoy working for a soulless corporation that actively engages in war profiteering and gets big government contracts and funding often. As much as I hate them, it's the only job I have that gets me out of conscription and puts food on the table.

I just hope that this war ends before Christmas.)"),
